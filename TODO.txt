Put panel in a draggable container *DONE*
Allow config for renderer and other things in the panel *DONE*
Check to see what is going on with props defined in react vs changes from panel. *DONE* R3F does deep compare
Add a way to hide/show separately pickers and helpers rather than all gizmos *DONE*
Make a play/stop game loop different from editor loop *DONE*
Improve makeHelpers *DONE*
Make labels expand on hover *DONE*
See if CustomControl can be improved *DONE*
When using different camera on play we might/will need different controller *DONE*
Fix keyup not firing when contextmenu in cPanel (keeps hanging fly navigation) *DONE* (preventing contextmenu on cPanel)
Bug: In continuous update in Orbit Controls the scene flickers. *DONE* (because  numberCommon.step was lower than 3 decimals precision)
Bug: After changing texture at runtime the details subfolder does not reflect it. *DONE* (rebuilding the tree manually on change)
Bug: After adding scene background (some large image) some commands in cPanel respond slowly (e.g. ContinuouslyUpdate, changing cameraType or controlType, play/stop) *DONE*
it seems it happens only after change until the texture is being rebuilt.
Bug: When the Scene gets a background from somewhere else, cPanel is not aware until some button click. *DONE*
(in loadImage we ask cPanel to rebuild itself - triggerCPaneStateChanged())
Bug: try playing with offset on Scene background after getting the green texture on it. It feels unresponsive. *DONE* (because texture is updated)
Bug?: The scene moving is not continuous. Is it from the mouse ?
The app has a bit of lag compared to: https://threejs.org/examples/?q=rotation#webgl_materials_texture_rotation which is instant *DONE* (re-rendering on OrbitControls change)
Make possible setting up cPanel opacity from itself so that it can be adjusted at runtime *DONE*
Make a help button and popup with all the shortcuts and explanations *DONE*
Find a way to solve conflict between scene background as texture and as folder *DONE*
The Scene background can be a Texture or Color. Adjust the controller for that. *WNF* (we show the type was has been set)
Allow user to adjust cPanel size the same as for opacity *DONE*
Bug: When hiding cPanel the cPanel draggable line is still visible. *DONE*
Make a type for userData *DONE*
Add controls for textures and materials *DONE*
Include sceneObjects with other props rather than making it separate. *DONE*
Checkout how does it happen that default cameras do not have helpers around them so that we should remove them. *DONE* (default cameras are not added to the scene)
Investigate the cameras being added when changing scene background mapping to rectangular
After they are added why they do  not move when dragged, or at least why the helpers do not move ?
*DONE* (added sub-cameras of CubeCamera to the skip list - it is not useful to have pickers for them. Also note that CubeCamera is not actually added to the scene)

Bug: spruit_sunrise_4k.hdr.jpg not working as cubemap (might need handling like here: webgl_loader_texture_hdrjpg.html)

Test matcap

Write doc about loading textures and cubeMaps

Be able to load complete materials from folder based on name

Check Threejs repo for code formatting.

Se where kandao3_depthmap.jpg is used in threejs examples

Bug: Changing rotation 90deg does not make it 90 but 90.012

Can we make an approach to share textures between objects? (this is good for sharing envMap)

Add loaders so that we can start the scene after everything was loaded

Do experiment with scene background reflection and object material reflection/refraction
// https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_materials_cubemap_refraction

Add FPS widget // https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_materials_cubemap_refraction
Integrate with Default LoadingManager.
Allow cors for loaders (can this be done with default load  manager ?)

Bug: Load Image from CParam then from SceneConfig.
After loading from scene config the binding reader fires continuously.
Not happening anymore since using correct internal lastValue.
However, to test with multi texture bindings later

Implement typing multiple letters as key listeners? add minimal custom controls to use in Experience for play/pause
Make a pause button

Add plugin for radio buttons
Add plugin for file upload (Texture, CubeTexture and Mesh and everything)
Add plugin for tree view,
Add text display plugin; to be used in showing quaternion, userData and other readonly fields

Add controls for scene
Show scene performance and statistics
Add top/left/bottom/right panel options


Get all calculations from old scene
See how we can use labels/projections in the scene leveraging Drei

Implement snapping

Cleanup package.json

Normalize all handlers to pointer instead of mouse.
